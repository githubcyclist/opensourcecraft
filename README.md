# OpenSourceCraft
An open source Minecraft clone written using jMonkeyEngine.

## I just wanna run it
You will need the JDK, and Ant is recommended.

Assuming everything's working, run the appropriate command in the repo directory:

### Windows - No Ant
`"ant/bin/ant.bat" run`

### Linux - No Ant
`./ant/bin/ant run`

### Any Platform - With Ant
`ant run`

## I wanna tinker!
Again, the JDK is required. Also, the JMonkeyEngine SDK. https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases

When downloading, select the appropriate binary (.sh or .exe). Run it, and install.

Once it's installed, select File > Import Project > From Zip...

If you haven't already, download the ZIP version. Select it and you're done!
